## Hi there 👋

This is the hub for our projects relating to improving cloud development tooling and experience on but not limitied to
[Gitpod](https://gitpod.io), including our [own take of workspace images](https://mau.dev/gitpodify/workspace-images) as used by our projects.

In the future we'll merge this with [Code Server Boilerplates](https://github.com/code-server-boilerplates) to simplify project
maintenance and management.

### The Crew

Most of the maintainers here are also part of [Recap Time Squad](https://mau.dev/recaptime-dev) either full or part time. If you want to help
us maintain the projects, stay tuned.
